# Data-Science-Principles-and-Practices-Project
This project showcases regression and classification tasks using Python and scikit-learn as part of the Data Science Principles and Practices module.

Tools and Libraries: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.



Regression Task

Dataset: syield.csv (Features: DOY, Yield).

Objective: Predict crop yield using linear and polynomial regression (degrees 2–5).

Evaluation: R-squared, RMSE, MAE.

Highlights: Visualized model fits and discussed overfitting/underfitting.



Classification Task

Dataset: ATLAS.csv (Features: V1–V29, Target: Signal).

Objective: Classify events as background or signal using logistic regression.

Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and other metrics.



Key Learnings

Implemented supervised learning techniques.

Evaluated and visualized model performance.

Discussed metric importance and model behavior.
